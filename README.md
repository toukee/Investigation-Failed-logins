# Investigation-Failed-logins

## Objective

To investigate an alert involving multiple failed login attempts across several systems and determine whether the activity represented normal user behavior or malicious brute‑force attempts. This project demonstrates my ability to analyze authentication logs, identify attacker patterns, correlate events across systems, and document findings using a structured SOC investigation workflow

### Skills Learned

- Identifying brute‑force indicators across authentication logs
- Reviewing failed login attempts targeting privileged accounts (Administrator, admin)
- Analyzing geographic anomalies in sign‑in activity (North Korea, Israel)
- Correlating events across multiple systems (SOC‑FW‑RDP, SHIR‑Hive, SHIR‑SAP)
- Understanding attacker intent based on targeted systems (Hive, SAP databases)
- Strengthening triage workflow: who → what → when → where → why → how
- Documenting findings clearly and professionally for SOC reporting
- Recommending security hardening measures such as MFA, lockout policies, and account hygiene


### Tools Used

- Microsoft Defender XDR – alert review, identity insights, geographic sign‑in analysis
- Microsoft Sentinel – log analysis, KQL queries, incident triage
- Azure Portal – reviewing user accounts, sign‑in logs, and resource activity
- Windows Event Viewer – authentication event validation
- CyberChef – decoding and quick data parsing
- VirusTotal – validating suspicious IP addresses
- Notepad++ – investigation notes and documentation
